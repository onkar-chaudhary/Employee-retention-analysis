# Employee_retention_analysis
This project analyzes employee survey data from Salifort Motors, a fictional electric vehicle manufacturer, to predict if an employee would leave the company. It utilizes a [chosen model type (regression or tree-based machine learning)] model to identify factors influencing departure of an employee and provide insights for improving employee satisfaction.

## Predicting Employee Retention at Salifort Motors

## Overview

Welcome to the Predicting Employee churn rate project repository! This project was completed as part of the capstone project for the  Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate program. In this project, we explore employee survey data from Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, to develop a model that predicts employee retention.

## Project Description

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, the task was to analyze the results of a recent employee survey and design a model to predict whether an employee will leave the company. Key features such as department, number of projects, and average monthly hours were used to build the predictive model.

## Repository Contents

- data/: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
- notebooks/: Directory containing Jupyter Notebooks detailing the data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- reports/: Directory containing the executive summary and a project proposal.
- README.md: You are here! This file provides an overview of the project and repository contents.


## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- *Data Cleaning*: Removed the null and duplicate values.
- *Data Exploration*: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset.
- *Data Visualisation*: Various kinds of graphs were created to visualize the relationships between them.
- *Model Building*: Regression (Logistic) and tree-based machine learning model (Decision Tree, Random forest, XGBoost) were trained and evaluated for predicting which employee would leave.
- *Model Interpretation*: Results of the models were interpreted to understand the key factors influencing an employee's departure.
- *Ethical Considerations*: Ethical implications of the analysis were considered throughout the project.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into employee retention at Salifort Motors. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, I have developed a predictive model that can assist the senior leadership team in making informed decisions to improve employee retention strategies.
